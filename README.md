# Cplusplus-Program
This repository started as a solution, containing clock projects from my CS-210 Programming Languages class at SNHU. From here it continued to grow as I explored C++ and developed skills and tactics to problem-solve using this language. All programs contain some commenting to give some insight as to what they are meant to do.

During the eight week course my personal focus was re-learning the syntax of C++, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of how to use VS to debug code and solve problems. Throughout the course I developed many different types of programs, from simple input-output files to more complex applications like the clock.cpp This projects helped me hone my strategies for problem solving using programming. My strengths in programming are 1: problem solving, 2: debugging, and 3: finding more elegant ways of doing something particularly mundane. For instance, most of my projects use a “menu.cpp”, which in my opinion is a much easier user interaction for selecting menu items than a simple list with a “type in a number” type of response.

Overall, I try to create simple, easily flowing code that runs well but also creates a fun and interactive user experience. I do this with all of my programs, keeping the user in mind and understanding that there is a particular intuitiveness that users expect when approaching a new program. The challenge to me is to find places where the code can be simplified, while still keeping the user experience intuitive. Creating modular applications that do tasks that are found in many programs I write is a key to keeping development time short and simple.

Included in this repository are all C++ programs that I have written, in no particular order, with comments at the top of each describing briefly what the app does. The future plans involve making brief videos to showcase the program so that anyone can see what they do without having to install, a sort of “demo-reel”.
